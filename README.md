# ZirconTech Libs

## Introduction

The purpose of this repo is to provide a set of internal libraries developed and maintained for use across our development projects. It serves as a reference for developers to understand, integrate, and utilize common functionalities and code components efficiently.

The internal libs encompass a range of code modules, components, and utilities that are reusable across projects. These libraries aim to standardize coding practices and streamline development by providing consistent and reliable functionality. The libraries include backend and frontend modules, as well as general utilities applicable to both sides. Some of the benefits of using this repo:

- **Improved Efficiency**: Streamlines development by providing pre-built modules and utilities, reducing the need for repetitive coding tasks.
- **Consistent Standards**: Promotes standardized coding practices and design patterns across projects.
- **Enhanced Collaboration**: Facilitates collaboration among team members by providing a common codebase and consistent interfaces.
